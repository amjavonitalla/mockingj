# MockingJ

## Possible Use Cases

Mobile and Client App Developers
--------------------------------
The backend is not yet ready. Instead of hard-coding expected response in your code mock the response and point your app to MockingJ.

Testing Negative Scenarios
--------------------------
Making the server fail is hard but with MockingJ you can set the response code or even make the request timeout.

Automated Testing
-----------------
Updating the response when testing a different scenario is tedious. MockingJ lets you group mock responses into a test case which you can access through a unique URL.
